# Project: ROCK PAPER SCISSORS

This project let you play a **Rock Paper Scissors** game in the browser's console.

### TODO:
[ ] Use CSS to improve the general aspect
[ ] Improve findWinner logic (maybe split it in two: one function to check if someone has won and one function to see who has won)
[ ] Try to use local variables other than global variables
